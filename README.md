Read the Application Note [here!](./docs/AN_2223_12001510_Cas_Truyers_ENG.pdf)

## Overview

This is a repository for the software development of an ESP32-based LED system designed for research on light spectrum influences on plant growth. The project utilizes the ESP-IDF framework, a widely-used and powerful development platform for programming ESP32 microcontrollers in C/C++.

## Weekly Reports

The weekly report of the projects developments can be found [here](./docs/weeklyReport.md)

## Features

- Utilizes ESP-IDF framework for programming the ESP32 microcontroller.
- Implements custom firmware for controlling the LED system.
- Interaction with LED_Drivers in OOP style.
- Web interface for controlling the light spectrum, intensity, and duration, tailored for research purposes.

## Dependencies

- ESP-IDF framework: The ESP-IDF library provides a rich set of APIs and tools for developing software on ESP32 microcontrollers, making it easier to write robust, efficient, and high-performance code.

## Getting Started

1. Install ESP-IDF framework: Follow the official ESP-IDF documentation to install the framework and set up the development environment.
2. Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Build and flash firmware: Use ESP-IDF tools to build and flash the firmware onto the ESP32 microcontroller.
